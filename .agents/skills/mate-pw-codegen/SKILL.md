description: >-
  SOLID Playwright Test Generation, StorageState Dependency Inversion & Network Mocking specialist using `@playwright/cli`.
  USE WHEN: You are converting `@playwright/cli` interactions (`#Ran Playwright code`), saved auth states (`state-save`),
  or CLI network mocks (`route`) into M.A.T.E.'s 4-layer OOP/SOLID automation architecture (`BaseComponent` -> `BasePage`
  -> `MateFixtures` -> `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`), or running and debugging Playwright tests via the CLI.
  SYNERGY: Works hand-in-hand with `mate-assert-playwright` (SOLID rules & Anti-Greenwashing `test.fail()` protocol),
  receives locators and test cases from `mate-pw-recon` and `mate-story-testcases`, and hands off failures to `mate-pw-forensics` and `mate-triage`.

# 🏗️ Skill: SOLID Codegen, Auth State & Network Mocking (`mate-pw-codegen`)

This skill governs **Phase 2 of `@playwright/cli` in M.A.T.E.**: transforming interactive CLI commands, authentication states, and network route mocks into **production-grade, Object-Oriented (OOP), SOLID TypeScript automation** that scales without technical debt.

## 🔗 Skill Synergy & Handoff Protocol

| Direction | Skill | How They Work Together |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Upstream** | **`mate-story-testcases` & `mate-pw-recon`** | Supplies the complete Test Case Matrix (`HAPPY_PATH`, `BORDER_CASE`, `NEGATIVE_PATH`, `STATE_TRANSITION`), verified locators, and which cases passed or failed live in the browser. |
| **Companion (Mandatory)** | **`mate-assert-playwright`** | Enforces `BasePage` / `BaseComponent` inheritance, `test.extend` Dependency Inversion, zero `waitForTimeout()`, and the **Anti-Greenwashing Mandate**. |
| **Downstream** | **`mate-pw-forensics` & `mate-triage`** | When a test fails during execution, captures traces/videos and files spec-linked bug reports (`npx mate-sdt bug`). |
| **Downstream (Audit)** | **`mate-maintenance`** | Runs `npx mate-sdt audit` after code generation to verify a `100/100 (Grade A)` health score. |

## 🏛️ 1. The 4-Layer SOLID Codegen Pipeline

Never paste raw `#Ran Playwright code` lines directly into `tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`. Every locator and action emitted by `playwright-cli` must flow through these 4 layers:

```text
[playwright-cli #Ran Playwright code]
        │
        ├──► Layer 1: src/components/<widget>.component.ts  (extends BaseComponent — SRP/OCP)
        ├──► Layer 2: src/pages/<domain>.page.ts            (extends BasePage — encapsulates locators)
        ├──► Layer 3: src/fixtures/mate.fixtures.ts         (test.extend<MateFixtures> — DIP + storageState)
        └──► Layer 4: tests/e2e/<domain>.spec.ts            (tests Happy + Border + Negative cases)
```

Always register every new Page Object, Component Object, and Fixture inside **`MATE-PROJECT-MAP.md`** so future sessions reuse them instead of duplicating classes.

## 🚨 2. Anti-Greenwashing Codegen Rule (Handling Failing Tests)

When automating the Test Case Matrix from `mate-story-testcases`:

1. **Automate ALL cases** (`HAPPY_PATH`, `BORDER_CASE`, `NEGATIVE_PATH`, `STATE_TRANSITION`)—never cherry-pick only the tests that pass!
2. **If a test fails because the application has a bug** (discovered during `mate-pw-recon` or when running `npx playwright test`):
   - **Keep the test in `tests/e2e/<domain>.spec.ts`** with the exact assertion required by the User Story / Spec Invariant (`[INV-XX]`).
   - **Never weaken or invert the assertion** to make a broken feature pass.
   - **Annotate the test with `test.fail()`** (or `test.fixme()` if it causes a hard timeout/crash) referencing the Bug ID:
     ```typescript
     test('TC-03: should floor order total at $0.00 when 100% coupon is applied [INV-01] @p1 @border', async ({
       checkoutPage,
     }) => {
       test.fail(true, 'BUG-20261111-CHECKOUT-01: App currently calculates -$5.00 instead of $0.00');
       await checkoutPage.navigate();
       await checkoutPage.applyCoupon('FREE100');
       await checkoutPage.expectTotalAmount('$0.00');
     });
     ```
   - Generate the bug report via `npx mate-sdt bug <module>` and report it clearly to the user:
     > *"⚠️ Automated 6 high-ROI test cases: 5 pass (`PASS`) and 1 fails due to a real application bug (`TC-03`, documented in `tests/bugs/BUG-...md` and marked with `test.fail()` in the suite). Additionally, 2 manual cases and 1 exploratory charter were documented in `tests/cases/TC-<module>.md`."*
